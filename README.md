# RSLC
RSLC is an on-going project that is roblox studio lag crasher. For example, maybe you want to implement this in your game in your game so that you can lag crash people instead of just straight up kicking them? In most cases, people don't like to be kicked out of games since they want to play. But here's a more damaging, less guiltful way to get them out of your game. You can LAG-CRASH THEM! Now while this one does have a kick associated with it, it's there to prevent any thing from happening to YOU. Since the lag crash can work on it's own, the kick si there to get YOU out of the game before you crash your Roblox / Roblox Studio.

# In order for the lag crash to work on it's own, you must remove line number 37 from LaggerServer.lua
